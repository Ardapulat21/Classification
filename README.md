# Classification Project

## Overview

This project aims to compare the performance of three different classification algorithms: 
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees

The goal is to evaluate their effectiveness in classifying a given dataset and to analyze their respective test results.
